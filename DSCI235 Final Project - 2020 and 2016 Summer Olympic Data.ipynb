    "For this project, I am analyzing data from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the Rio 2016 Olympics. The Olympic Games are a fascinating event, bringing the world together to appreciate excellence in athletics. The numerous different events, countries, and people competing in the Olympic Games give ample material to analyze. Finding patterns and interesting information in this Olympic data will likely change the way we see the games in the future and make us think about the nature of sports in a new way. This project will also be challenging and help us develop our teamwork, communication, and data wrangling skills. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using 2 .csv files for our project. I have a main data set that is for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. It includes data sorted by athlete name, with information on each athlete including age, country, sport, event, rank, and medal earned. The data set has multiple entries for each athlete as many athletes compete in multiple events. I have not decided how I am going to sort/filter the data for each individual athlete as they are each in the data set multiple times. I will use a 2016 Olympics in Rio De Janeiro data set to be able to determine if there were any repeat medalists and if there were more female or male medalists in 2016 vs. 2020. <br>\n",

    "   - Are there events that tend to have older competitors? Meaning, is the mean age of athletes competing in a specific event greater than 30?<br>\n",

    "   - What does the age distribution of their sport in 2016 and 2020 look like, if available? <br>\n",
    "   - Do any of them compete in the events that tend to have younger or older competitors, respectively? <br>\n",
    "   - Did any of these athletes compete in 2016 and 2020?\n",
    "5. Which Olympic athlete has the most medals in 2016? <br>\n",

    "4. Does the United States have more female or male medalists in 2020?\n",

    "Both, the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Datasets, have Table Tennis included so we can do a direct comparison of the age distribution of the event in both olympics. We can see from both histograms that the age distribution is right skewed with a few outliers on each end of the distribution. These graphs are not as heavily right skewed as the Aquatics event from 2016 as there are no competitors over the age of 45 in that event, but table tennis still has quite a few competitors that are in the younger age bracket, making the histogram right skewed.

    "Both, the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Datasets, have Equestrian included so we can do a direct comparison of the age distribution of the event in both olympics. We can see that the age data associated with equestrians is more spread out than other sports such as aquatics or skateboarding. This means that for equestrians, it is more likely to have an older athlete competing as the distribution is closer to uniform than in the sports, like aquatics or skateboarding, where the graph is heavily right skewed because the athletes in that sport are generally younger."

All of the younger athletes, specifically the top 5 in our case, compete in events that are heavily right skewed. This demonstrates that this event tends to have younger athletes competing. For the older compeditors, specifically the top 5 in our data, compete in the same event, Equestrian. The Equestrian event has a different distibution than the other events we looked at because the mean age of competitors in the Equestrian event is over the age of 30. //TODO"
